This case should print just fine on any 3D printer since it's not unnecessarily large. However this will not be a quick print due to the thickness of the walls, which is necessary since PLA printed items will warp if exposed to escessive heat. I'm not even joking for a minute, on a Creality Ender 5 Pro running at standard resolution and using 30% infill, the top of the case takes 8.5 hours and the bottom takes over 24 hours. Making the walls thinner and reducing the infill doesn't have that much effect on the time to print.

I intend to sell Boilermakers as assembled and tested units _(and pre-configured for the customer's WiF network)_, and I really can't afford to send out units where the case will warp due to excessive internal heat. $30 for a weather-proof ABS outdoor utility enclosure also doesn't make sense to me for something like this. Especially since a 1 KG roll of PLA filament is only $23 and I could print 6 cases.

This case was designed to accommodate an [SSR-40DA](https://www.amazon.com/Inkbird-Solid-Thermostat-Temperature-Controller/dp/B00HV974KC/) mounted to a [large heat sink](https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Aluminum-Dissipation-Single-10A-100A/dp/B07C8R7MS2/).

This case supports both a standard [38 Pin ESP32](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09J95SMG7/) or a [LilyGo T-Display-S3](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BRTT727Z/) in the factory shell. Some people may want a local LCD display on their Boilermaker controller, so the LilyGo unit solves that problem for not a whole lot of money. The 38 Pin ESP32 mounts in the same place as the LilyGo, but requires an additional cover _(**BM-ESP32-Cover.stl**)_ to be 3D printed tp keep it in place.

This design is also based around a bus bar in the bottom of the case, but includes holes for strain reliefs in case you decide to sacrifice a 12 gauge extension cord. Holes in the bottom of the case are also provided in the event that you want to wall mount the unit like I did. There is also a 50mm fan mounting footprint between the AC power cable holes. You should install your fan so that it pulls cool air through the heat sink and evacuates the heat from the case.

This case should print just fine on any 3D printer since it's not unnecessarily large. However this will not be a quick print due to the thickness of the walls, which is necessary since PLA printed items will warp if exposed to escessive heat. This case was designed to accommodate an [SSR-40DA](https://www.amazon.com/Inkbird-Solid-Thermostat-Temperature-Controller/dp/B00HV974KC/) mounted to a [large heat sink](https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Aluminum-Dissipation-Single-10A-100A/dp/B07C8R7MS2/). I intend to sell these as assembled and tested units, and can't afford to send out units where the case will warp.

This case supports both a standard 38 Pin ESP32 or a [LilyGo T-Display-S3](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BRTT727Z/) in the factory shell.

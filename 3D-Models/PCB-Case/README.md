# 3D Model Notes

The models in this directory are for use with the PCB designed by [FireflySE](https://github.com/FireflySE) of Sweden. If you intend to sell assembled and tested Boilermakers, you will want to use the PCB and this case to make things easier on yourself. This case is 20mm longer than the one for prototype build and uses a different cover. This case is also 10mm taller in order to better accommodate 100 amp solid state relays.

Pictured above is the inside of a Boilermaker that I'm preparing for an order placed on my website. This is one where a customer ordered it with the 120 volt 12 gauge pigtails. This should help those who  purchased the hard-wired version for a permanent installation, or intend to use it with a 240 volt boiler.

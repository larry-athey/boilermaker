Pictured above is the inside of a Boilermaker that I'm preparing for an order placed on my website. This is one where a customer ordered it with the 120 volt 12 gauge pigtails. This should help those who  purchased the hard-wired version for a permanent installation, or intend to use it with a 240 volt boiler.

If you're looking at this Boilermaker from the front, the power input is on the left side. The neutral line (N) from the Boilermaker power supply line is connected to the first row of terminal bus bar on the bottom of the case and the hot line (L) is connected to the left AC terminal of the solid state relay.

The main AC power input lines connect to the same places as the Boilermaker's power supply wires. The ground wire from the main AC input cable connects to the third row of the terminal bus bar.

The AC power output to the boiler is on the right side. The hot wire connects to the right terminal of the solid state relay. The neutral wire connects to the second row of the terminal bus bar. The ground wire connects to the fourth row of the terminal bus bar.

A person can just as easily switch things around and use the right side as the power input, it doesn't matter which side of the solid state relay is used as the input.

**PRO TIP:** If your temperature sensor stops reading when it comes into contact with your boiler, your hot and neutral lines to the Boilermaker power supply are reversed or you have a defective ground connection. Double check your outlet with a plug-in outlet analyzer to make sure there are no problems with your AC power wiring at the outlet.

_**NOTE:** In the case of a 240 volt setup, you would just use the extra hot line in the place of the neutral line of the 120 volt wiring. The 240 volt neutral wires would just connect where the ground wires connect in the 120 volt wiring. If you happen to be using a 4-conductor cable (12/4 SOOW), the bus bar has an extra pair of jumped terminals for your ground wires._

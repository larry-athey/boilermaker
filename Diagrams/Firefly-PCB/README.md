# About this PCB

This is designed by [FireflySE](https://github.com/FireflySE) of Sweden, the same guy who designed the RPi Hat for the [RPi Smart Still](https://github.com/larry-athey/rpi-smart-still) controller system.

This board supports both, type-k thermocouple or DS18B20 temperature sensors. As of this time, my 3D models for the case don't support this PCB because I don't have any on-hand. As soon as I have some, I will update the case models to support this PCB as well.

_**NOTE:** You will need to modify the source code to work with this PCB. My original code has the FAN_OUT constant pointing to GPIO 16, this PCB has it on GPIO 2._

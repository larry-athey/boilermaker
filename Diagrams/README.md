# Coming Soon

_**NOTE:** If you are just going to be using this with a small still (1200 watts or less) and a DS18B20 temperature sensor, you can simply use the [PSU and Interface](https://github.com/larry-athey/airhead/tree/main/Diagrams) schematic and PCB for the Airhead project. You can also directly drive a 3.3 volt 50mm fan from the GPIO port if you feel that you want to add a fan to it. A 1200 watt load really won't warm up the SSR heat sink that much._

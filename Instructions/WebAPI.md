# Web API Usage

The WebUI communicates with the Boilermaker using HTTP API calls since it's a single page web user interface that dynamically updates using Ajax refresh. All settings except for the WiFi configuration can be configured using plain old HTTP GET requests, which means you can configure pretty much everything just by typing URLs into your web browser's address bar.

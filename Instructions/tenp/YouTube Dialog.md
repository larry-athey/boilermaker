Hey there, me again.

{ Larry Who jump cuts }

Yep, I've kinda had an extended YouTube absence. The novelty of it pretty much wore off because they're more concerned with trying to overtake TikTok with their short form videos. Why bother creating long form videos if they're only going to get 10 or 20 views because the world's attention span has been reduced to a minute?

Anyway, my attention has been focused on my own projects and a few contract jobs creating stuff for other people. I recently started working with an online marketing specialist and she insisted that I create a Facebook page for my LLC. So I contacted the friend who was posting things on Facebook for me a couple years ago under one of his alt accounts and we renamed the account so I wouldn't have to go through all of the ID verification crap. I've included a link to the page in the description.

Just a couple days into cruising Facebook groups again, I quickly remembered why I deleted my personal account 5 years ago. Most of the distillation related groups have problem users in them that absolutely hate it when someone new in the group comes up with something that they couldn't have come up with, not even on their best day. The guy who invented the MyVodkaMaker went through the same thing, but he told me that Reddit was even worse.

Luckily, **most** of those users are concentrated in groups related to Still Spirits brand products (Air Still and the T500) as well as anything related to the Still It YouTube channel. This is because Jesse Wilsson is probably who most people actually learned about the Air Still from. Most of them actually think sugar shine with a Still Spirits essence bottle is how to make  a plausible bourbon or Jack Daniel's equivalent. So, you really can't take them that seriously.

However, when I created a few posts about my Airhead power/temperature controller for the Air Still, I'd say about 10 people in various groups came up with the same weak point to try and diminish my efforts. However, all they actually succeeded in doing is proving how little they know and how much they've actually settled for mediocre results. **"I have a PID controller that works just fine"** True, it works just fine for delivering the wrong result for distillation.

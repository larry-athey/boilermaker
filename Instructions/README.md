# Instructions

Unlike other WiFi enabled ESP32 powered devices, the Boilermaker does not default as a WiFi access point in order to configure it. I'm already using nearly 75% of the available code space, I don't want to waste the remaining 25% on a one-time-use feature. I'm reserving that 25% for future features and enhancements, so the WiFi configuration and a few other things are configured over a USB cable and a plain old terminal program. Windows doesn't include one by default anymore, but [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) is free and open source.

[Here's how to use PuTTY under Windows to connect to the Boilermaker.](https://x.com/i/grok/share/i61lGPHt1tv3cxOr8ogD5S6SR)

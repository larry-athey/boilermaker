# Instructions

Unlike other WiFi enabled ESP32 powered devices, the Boilermaker does not default as a WiFi access point in order to configure it. I'm already using nearly 75% of the available code space, I don't want to waste the remaining 25% on a one-time-use feature. I'm reserving that 25% for future features and enhancements, so the WiFi configuration and a few other things are configured over a USB cable and a plain old terminal program. Windows doesn't include one by default anymore, but [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) is free and open source.

Mac OS users can install the free [CoolTerm](https://freeware.the-meiers.org/) program, which is also available for Linux desktop systems, including Raspberry Pi computers. Linux users can also install any of the many command line terminal program with their package manager, such as minicom. Seriously, serial terminal programs are as old as computers themselves, this is nothng new.

# Web User Interface

The WebUI is designed for cell phone screens in vertical/portrait mode. It will still work on desktop/laptop/tablet screens, but will appear stretched out. I would add more code to fine tune it to be more friendly to larger screen sizes, but I'm working with a limited amount of code space in the ESP32 and I already have it 75% full. If you must use it on a desktop PC, use Firefox and switch it into mobile app view by pressing **CTRL+Shift+M** or **Command+Option+M** if you are using a Mac.

It is important to remember that the Boilermaker code is derived from the [Airhead](https://github.com/larry-athey/airhead), which is a port of PHP to C++ from my [RPi Smart Still](https://github.com/larry-athey/rpi-smart-still) boiler management routines.

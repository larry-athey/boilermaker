# Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Are there any plans to add volt/amp meter functionality to the Boilermaker?

A: No, and this should actually be a meter on the outlet or junction box that you are connected to because that's what you should actually be monitoring. Those meters are dirt cheap, just connect it to your AC feed lines and put the inductive donut around your hot wire.
